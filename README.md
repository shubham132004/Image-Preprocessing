##  What's Covered in the Notebook

The notebook (`Image_preprocessing-Assignment.ipynb`) walks through the following tasks:

- Opening and inspecting image properties (format, size, mode)
- Converting images to grayscale
- Resizing, cropping, and rotating images
- Adjusting image:
  - Brightness
  - Contrast
  - Sharpness
  - Color saturation
- Drawing on images (rectangles and basic shapes)
- Splitting and analyzing RGB color channels
- Creating a basic 2Ã—2 image collage
